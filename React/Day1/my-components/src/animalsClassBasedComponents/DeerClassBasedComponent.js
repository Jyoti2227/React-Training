                deer, (family Cervidae), any of 43 species of hoofed ruminants in the order
                 Artiodactyla, notable for having two large and two small hooves on each foot 
                 and also for having antlers in the males of most species and in the females 
                 of one species. Deer are native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, 
                 and many species have been widely introduced beyond their original habitats as 
                 game animals. One species, the reindeer (also known as the caribou), has been 
                 domesticated. Some swamp and island species are endangered, but most continental 
                 species are flourishing under protection and good management. Deer, when granted 
                 some protection, readily exploit man-made disturbances caused by agriculture, 
                 forestry, and urbanization. White-tailed deer, normally a cherished North 
                 American game animal, have even become pests in suburbs and cities in the 
                 United States and Canada.
