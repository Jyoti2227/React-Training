                    Tigers are terrestrial mammals that belong to the genus “Panthera” a
                     classification that groups the five species of big cats: lions, jaguars, 
                     leopards, snow leopards, and tigers. They are easily recognizable by their 
                     unique black striped pattern on a dark orange coat and because they are the 
                     largest species of the Felidae family. The tiger 
                    (Panthera tigris) is the largest of the five big cats that belong to the genus “Panthera.”
