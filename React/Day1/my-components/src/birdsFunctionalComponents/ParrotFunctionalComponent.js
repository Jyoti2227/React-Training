                    Parrots have a compact body with a large head and a short neck. 
                    Their beaks are short, strong and curved. The two parts of 
                    the beak are very strong and used to break fruits and seeds. 
                    The tongue is large and strong. Most parrots can fly, though some lost their powers of
                    flight after they came to live on oceanic islands. The kakapo is an example.
