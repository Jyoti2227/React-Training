            Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a skin saddle (cere) 
            between the bill and forehead. All pigeons strut about with a characteristic 
            bobbing of the head. 
            Because of their long wings and powerful flight muscles, they are strong, swift fliers.
            </p>
