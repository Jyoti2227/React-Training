            The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), also known as the common peafowl, and 
            blue peafowl, is a peafowl species native to the Indian subcontinent. 
            It has been introduced to many other countries. Male peafowl 
            are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, 
            although both sexes are often referred to colloquially as a "peacock".
